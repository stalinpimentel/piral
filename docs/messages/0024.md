# Error: 0024

The desired version is invalid.

## Description

For updating a Piral instance the provided version must be a valid version
identifier (e.g., 0.10.0) or a valid tag (e.g., latest).

Before an update is performed the desired version is checked with the available
versions. If no release for the given version was found then an error is emitted.

## Example

Check that the version is valid:

```sh
npm show piral-cli version --tag 0.10.10
```

The result has to be a valid version answer. In the given example there is no
response, so it is empty. A valid response appear for:

```sh
npm show piral-cli version --tag 0.10.9
```

Here the answer is 0.10.9.
