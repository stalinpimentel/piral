# Warning: 0023

Cannot pack the package.

## Description

For updating a Piral instance the packages have to be installed. Otherwise,
it is impossible for the Piral CLI to detect what packages need to be updated
and which ones can remain at their current version.

## Example

Check that the package is indeed installed:

```sh
cat node_modules/{missing-package}/package.json
```

The displayed content should look similar to:

```json
{
  "name": "missing package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {},
  "devDependencies": {}
}
```

The exact values do not matter much, but rather that the file is found at all.
