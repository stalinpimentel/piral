# Error: 0060

Incomplete configuration. Missing URL of the pilet feed.

## Description

The publish command works either against the official public feed using a feed name
(e.g., `sample`) or a fully qualified URL working against *any* feed service.

Make sure that the provided publish endpoint URL follows the Feed Service API specification.

If the URL is missing (i.e., not provided) then the Piral CLI does not know to which feed
service to publish.

## Example

Always specify the URL via the `--url` provider.

```sh
pilet publish --url https://feed.piral.cloud/api/v1/pilet/sample
```
