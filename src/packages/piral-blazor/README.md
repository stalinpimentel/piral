This is a plugin that only has a peer dependency to `piral-core`. What `piral-blazor` brings to the table is a set of Pilet API extensions that can be used with `piral` or `piral-core`.

The set includes an Blazor loader and converter for any component registration, as well as a `fromBlazor` shortcut together with some Blazor component coming in the `Piral.Blazor.Utils` NuGet package.

By default, these API extensions are not integrated in `piral`, so you'd need to add them to your Piral instance.

## Documentation

As Blazor is quite a special technology (since its based on WebAssembly) there are some very special things to follow for integration. The result, however, could be worth it. As Piral gives you here a truly unique and wonderful way of building your application - modular, distributed, and with the fastest possible Blazor startup time!

**Important**:
We recommend building pilets for `piral-blazor` exclusively with the official template.

The template can be installed using the `dotnet` CLI:

```sh
dotnet new -i Piral.Blazor.Template
```

Then you can always apply the template in an empty folder:

```sh
dotnet new blazorpilet --piralInstance my-app-shell
```

where `my-app-shell` should refer to the name of the NPM package of your app shell. The `--npmRegistry` option is there, to cover cases where your app shell is not hosted in the standard NPM registry.

The following functions are brought to the Pilet API.

### `defineBlazorReferences()`

Adds the URLs to additional DLLs that need to be referenced for obtaining the Blazor components. At best this uses `require.resolve` to get the URL from the bundler.

When you use the `blazorpilet` template you don't need to fill / use this. It is automatically used and filled with generated code. Only touch this one if you know what you are doing.

### `fromBlazor()`

Transforms a standard Blazor component into a component that can be used in Piral, essentially wrapping it with a reference to the corresponding converter.

There is only a single argument, which refers to the name of the exposed Blazor component.

## Usage

> For authors of pilets

You can use the `fromBlazor` function from the Pilet API to convert your Blazor components to components usable by your Piral instance.

Example use:

```ts
import { PiletApi } from '<name-of-piral-instance>';

export function setup(piral: PiletApi) {
  piral.defineBlazorReferences([
    require.resolve('./My.Dependency.dll'),
    require.resolve('./My.Components.dll'),
  ])
  piral.registerPage('/sample', piral.fromBlazor('sample-page'));
}
```

Within Blazor components the `Extension` component referenced from `Piral.Blazor.Utils`, e.g.,

```jsx
<Extension name="name-of-extension" />
```

## Setup and Bootstrapping

> For Piral instance developers

Using Blazor with Piral is as simple as installing `piral-blazor`.

```ts
import { createBlazorApi } from 'piral-blazor';
```

The integration looks like:

```ts
const instance = createInstance({
  // important part
  extendApi: [createBlazorApi()],
  // ...
});
```

This will automatically download and include the necessary binary files for providing Blazor WASM support. The binary files will be taken from the `Piral.Blazor.Core` NuGet package.

By default, the latest version of the `Piral.Blazor.Core` NuGet package is downloaded. To change this set the `PIRAL_BLAZOR_VERSION` environment variable to the desired version.
